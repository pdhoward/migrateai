### AI Workflow

Migrating applications with embedded pipeline intelligence

NOTE - in order for a target github repo to be handled by this ai web container

1. a package.json must be added to the target repo which imports nextjs app with ai functions

2. a post install bash script must be added to the target repo to copy the app from node_modules to root

3. add a .gitignore to ignore active changes in node_modules

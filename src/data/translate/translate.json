        "text": "Agile Story: File Reading and Customer Record Retrieval \\n As a system user, I want the application to read customer records from the 'CUSTFILE' data file using a specific key value, so that we can efficiently access customer information. \\n Acceptance Criteria: \\n 1. The application sets the file's data description (DD) name to 'CUSTFILE' in the variable \"WS-M03B-DD.\" \\n 2. The boolean flag \"M03B-READ-K\" is correctly set to TRUE to enable sequential reading of the file. \\n 3. The application moves the value of \"XREF-CUST-ID\" to \"WS-M03B-KEY\" for identifying the customer record to be retrieved. \\n 4. The variable \"WS-M03B-KEY-LN\" is initialized to 'ZERO' to store the length of the key value. \\n 5. The length of \"XREF-CUST-ID\" is accurately calculated and stored in \"WS-M03B-KEY-LN\" using the \"LENGTH OF\" keyword. \\n 6. The return code variable \"WS-M03B-RC\" is appropriately initialized to 'ZERO' to capture the result of the file access operation. \\n 7. The customer record retrieved from the file is stored in the variable \"WS-M03B-FLDT\" after being initialized with \"SPACES\" (blank). \\n 8. The subprogram \"CBSTM03B\" is invoked, passing the data structure \"WS-M03B-AREA\" as a parameter to read the customer record based on the specified key. \\n 9. After reading the record, the application evaluates the value of \"WS-M03B-RC\": \\n a. If \"WS-M03B-RC\" is '00', the application proceeds with the next steps. \\n b. For any other value of \"WS-M03B-RC,\" an error message is displayed along with the return code, and the \"9999-ABEND-PROGRAM\" section is executed to terminate the program abnormally. \\n 10. If no error occurred, the customer record read from the file, stored in \"WS-M03B-FLDT,\" is correctly moved to the variable \"CUSTOMER-RECORD\" to hold the retrieved customer data. \\n 11. Upon completion of the \"2000-CUSTFILE-GET\" section, the application continues with the rest of the code execution for further processing. \\n Note: The application should handle various scenarios efficiently and provide appropriate error handling for exceptional cases. The story implementation should be well-tested to ensure accurate retrieval of customer records from the 'CUSTFILE' file.",

Objective:\nThe objective of the test is to verify the functionality and correctness of the \"9300-GETACCTDATA-BYACCT\" COBOL code that executes a READ operation using CICS to retrieve account data based on the specified account identifier.\n\n2. Scope:\nThe test will focus on validating the following aspects of the COBOL code:\n- Proper execution of the CICS READ operation.\n- Accurate retrieval of account data from the specified dataset.\n- Correct setting of flags and variables based on different response scenarios.\n- Accurate construction of error messages in case of data not found or other errors.\n\n3. Test Environment:\nThe test environment should be set up with the required COBOL runtime environment, CICS emulator, and relevant datasets, including the \"LIT-ACCTFILENAME\" dataset.\n\n4. Test Data:\nTest data should be prepared to cover various scenarios, including:\n- Account identifiers present in the dataset.\n- Account identifiers not found in the dataset.\n- Incorrect or invalid account identifiers.\n- Different response codes from the CICS READ operation.\n5. Test Cases:\nThe test cases should cover the following scenarios:\na. Verify successful retrieval of account data when the account identifier is present in the dataset. Check that \"FOUND-ACCT-IN-MASTER\" flag is set to TRUE.\nb. Verify correct handling when the account identifier is not found in the dataset. Check that \"INPUT-ERROR\" and \"FLG-ACCTFILTER-NOT-OK\" flags are set to TRUE.\nc. Validate the construction of error messages when the account identifier is not found or there is any other error in the READ operation.\nd. Test with various response codes returned by the CICS READ operation to ensure proper handling of different scenarios.\n\n6. Automation:\nConsider automating the execution of test cases using appropriate testing frameworks to ensure consistency and efficiency in testing.\n\n7. Error Handling and Logging:\nEnsure that appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place, and relevant logs are generated to capture any issues encountered during testing.\n\n8. Performance and Scalability:\nEvaluate the performance of the code under different loads and datasets to ensure it can handle real-world scenarios with large datasets efficiently.\n9. Boundary and Negative Testing:\nPerform boundary testing to check the behavior of the code when the account identifier is at its minimum and maximum valid lengths. Also, perform negative testing with invalid account identifiers to validate error handling.\n\n10. Integration Testing:\nPerform integration testing with other components that interact with the \"9300-GETACCTDATA-BYACCT\" code to ensure smooth interaction and data flow.\n\n11. Regression Testing:\nEnsure that any changes or enhancements made to the code in the future do not adversely affect existing functionality by conducting regression testing.\n\n12. Test Reports and Documentation:\nProduce comprehensive test reports documenting test results, test cases executed, issues identified, and resolutions applied.\n\n13. Review:\nConduct a review of the code with relevant stakeholders to validate the test strategy and ensure all requirements are met.",
